\section{Introduction}
This proposal aims to investigate homoclinic orbits in the dynamical system known as the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3PB). The CR3PB, further described in the following section, is a classical astrodynamics problem that has been studied for over 200 years and contains a plethora of interesting dynamical phenomena, including homoclinic orbits. 

In mathematics, a homoclinic orbit is defined as a trajectory of a flow of a dynamical system which joins a saddle equilibrium point to itself. More precisely, a homoclinic orbit lies in the intersection of the stable manifold, $W^s(p)$, and the unstable manifold, $W^u(p)$, of an equilibrium. Figure \ref{f:homoclinic_example} shows an example of a simple, two-dimensional homoclinic orbit about the saddle equilibrium point $p$. As the figure shows, as time approaches either negative or positive infinity, the homoclinic orbit will approach $p$.

Homoclinic orbits, first discovered by Henri Poincar\'{e} in the 1885 Acta Mathematica competition sponsored by King Oscar II of Sweden, play an important role in the chaotic behavior of a dynamical system. Lying on the intersection between a stable and unstable manifold of the same equilibrium point, or orbit, the geometry of homoclinic orbits (i.e., the geometry of the manifold intersection) offers a way in which simple local information can be extrapolated to complicated global behavior. This proposal looks to study Poincar\'{e}'s work on homoclinic orbits and use that knowledge to find examples of homoclinic orbits in the CR3BP.
